This example is using Rdio API. 
The Rdio Android SDK lets developers call the web service API, authenticate
users if the Rdio Android app is installed, and play full song streams or
30 second samples.

Full API documentation is available: http://www.rdio.com/media/static/developer/android/docs/

The implementation with Google Glass is added to make easier Rdio users access to their music!
